# Custom Sentences

My collection of custom intents for Home Assistant assist. Intent scripts suck compared to actual integrations (and should be fixed or replaced).

Here are my intents:

- `ConversationProcess`
- `RandomNumber`
- `CurrentTime`

## Installation

Standard HACS installation (you know the drill). Then copy the `custom_sentences` folder to your `config` directory in HomeAssistant.
